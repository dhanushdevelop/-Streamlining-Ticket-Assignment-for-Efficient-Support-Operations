🚀 Solution Overview
"Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations" leverages ServiceNow's Flow Designer to create an intelligent routing system that automatically analyzes ticket content and directs them to appropriate support groups.

The system intelligently parses the "Issue" field from incoming tickets—identifying keywords like "Certificates," "404 Error," or other technical terms—and instantly routes them to specialized support teams ("Certificates Team," "Platform Team," etc.), ensuring optimal resource allocation and expertise matching.
